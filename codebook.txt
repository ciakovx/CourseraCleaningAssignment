tidyData.csv codebook
===================

Original data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip on 11/16/2014.

Processing was run on 11/23/2014 with the run_analysis script on GitHub at .

subject
===================
The subject variable is a 30 level factor vector, with numerals as labels, with each factor level representing a different volunteer. Volunteers from both the test and the train data are included in the tidyData.csv, and no indication is made to specify which volunteer came from which subject came from which collection. For more details on the subjects, see the README.txt in the UCI HAR Dataset directory.

activity
===================
The activity variable is a 6 level factor vector, with character strings as labels, with each factor level representing an activity that the volunteer did as the measurements were taken.

signal
===================

The signal variable is a 66 level factor vector, with character strings as labels, with each factor representing a signal measurement. See features_info.txt in the UCI HAR Dataset directory for full details on feature selection..

Only signals that were measurements of mean and standard deviation were collected. The process for that identification is in the README.txt. The signal name strings were modified in the run_analysis.R script, as detailed in the README.txt.

avgMeasurement
===================

The avgMeasurement variable is a numeric vector. The averages measurements for each signal per subject and activity were calculated.
